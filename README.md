# Sampling

Sampling Methods assignment

Here I have implemented 5 sampling techniques each on 5 machine learning models and compared their accuracies

Sampling techniques used are: simple random sampling,stratified sampling, systematic sampling, cluster sampling and random oversampling

machine learning models implemented are: Logistic regression, SVM, KNN, XGBoost and Random Forest Classifier
